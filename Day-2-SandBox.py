# print("Hello"[0,2])
# the [] is helping me geting just one letter out of a string
# num = 123_456_789
# print(num)
# num = input("What number? ")
# print(type(num))
# this down here changes num from string into float
# new_num = float(num)
# print(type(new_num))
# inputs work with floats it actually turns it into a string
#  + addition
#  - subtraction
#  * mutiplacation
#  / division 
#  ** to the power/exponets
# Python follows PEMDAS
# print(3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3) 
#  or put () round the 3 + 3 instead of swaping / from +
# print(type(round(8 / 3)))
# the round variable rounds the numbers togetherI could also just put the // in there instead and it will not
# round but automaticly turn a flowting point value into a int 
#  print(8 // 3)
# / always float point // always int

# f-string
# f"words in here{int/boolean/other}"
